Exploratory Data Analysis for Hotel Booking Demand

Introduction:
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking demand. The hospitality industry has been undergoing significant changes due to advancements in technology and the impact of the pandemic. Through data analysis, valuable insights can be obtained to help hotels improve their services and optimize their operations.

Data Description:
For this analysis, I utilized the Hotel Booking Demand dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of two separate hotel datasets, one for a city hotel and another for a resort hotel. The data was originally collected by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal.

The city hotel dataset contains 79,330 observations with 32 features. Some of the key features include:

Hotel: Indicates whether it is a resort hotel or a city hotel.
Is_canceled: A binary value indicating if the booking was canceled or not.
Lead_time: The number of days between the booking date and the arrival date.
Arrival_date_year: The year of the arrival date.
Arrival_date_month: The month of the arrival date.
Arrival_date_week_number: The week number of the year for the arrival date.
Adults/Children/Babies: The number of adults, children, and babies included in the booking.
Meal: The type of meal booked.
Country: The country of origin of the guest.
Market_segment: The designation of the market segment, such as travel agents or tour operators.
Distribution_channel: The booking distribution channel, indicating if it was through travel agents or tour operators.
Is_repeated_guest: Indicates if the booking was made by a repeated guest or not.
Previous_cancellations: The number of previous bookings canceled by the customer.
Reserved_room_type/Assigned_room_type: Codes representing the reserved and assigned room types.
Booking_changes: The number of changes made to the booking before check-in or cancellation.
Deposit_type: Indicates if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking.
Methodology:
In conducting the EDA, I used Python programming language and Jupyter Notebooks. The dataset was imported and various data exploration techniques were applied to gain insights and summarize the findings. This involved analyzing the distribution of variables, identifying patterns and trends, and conducting statistical analyses where applicable.


Through this EDA, I aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the hotel booking demand dataset. By exploring the features and relationships within the data, valuable insights can be obtained to support decision-making and improve hotel operations. The findings from this analysis contribute to the broader understanding of the hospitality industry and its response to various factors affecting bookings.
